simpleChess
===========

This is just a fun project for me to learn some basics of html and javascript.

It is a simple chess game, that I plan to chip away at and add features/improvements.

There is one special thing about this game - it's a variation that I think may be fun to play. When a piece captures, it becomes the piece that it captured. For example, if a knight captures a pawn, the knight _becomes_ a pawn. I have no idea how this will pan out, but it's fun to think about.
